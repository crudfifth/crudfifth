Thank you for visiting our Github profile.
I'm Tsunami.
We are working under the team name CRUD5th.
My specialty is in the WEB area,
but I'm also working on low-layer OS development.
Currently, I'm aiming to be a generalist who can cover a wide range of technologies
rather than increasing my technical depth.
If you find any repositories you can use,
please feel free to use them.
